#### Highlights

* Taiwan style Beef Noodles
* Good quality Bubble Tea! (**Pro-tip:** Get the bartender to swap out milk for Kahlua and baileys for that extra kick to it)
* [Studio Ilse](http://www.studioilse.com) Interior designs are amazing

#### Pluses for the lounge

* Feels homely like a living room
* Fast internet (mostly)

#### Minuses for the lounge

* No showers
* No champagne (but there's Taiwan beer and bubble tea!)

Another throwback from last year. The studioilse version of this lounge opened after October 2015.

Prior to the lounge opening, the only Highlight was the beef noodles and the lounge was very small. I don't have any old photos, but check out these yelp reviews [here(1)](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cathay-pacific-vip-lounge-%E5%A4%A7%E5%9C%92%E5%8D%80) and [here(2)](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cathay-pacific-first-and-business-class-lounge-%E5%A4%A7%E5%9C%92%E5%8D%80) to have an idea of the massive changes.

As you enter the lounge, there is a luggage storage area so you don't have to cart your bags through the large lounge. Put stuff you won't be needing in the lounge here then go onward. The first section is a communal dining (or work) table and a dessert bar at the end.

Then there's a small work area with Mac's and Printers. The printers only do black and white. I found that you can actually print from your own computer to the printers too.

Next section is the main dining section (for hot food) or noodle bar section where you can order made to order food, such as some Taipei lounge exclusives such as Beef noodles, and general stuff like wonton noodles and dan dan noodles (usually I just go for the wonton noodles). As I've been to this lounge many times on different days, I've also noted that the other Taiwanese Item on the menu rotates. I've had a BBQ Pork sandwhich (Taiwanese style) on one of the days, and on another occasion I've had a sweet potato (yam) dessert dish.

There is also a western item on the menu too. I ordered it once just to try it (at the time it was a Panini). It's not too bad, but the chefs probably aren't used to cooking those sorts of stuff.

It doesn't seem to be day specific either, just to keep things interesting I guess. The dumplings also change too, sometimes theres siu mai (shao mai in Taiwan / 燒賣), sometimes theirs har gow (xia gow in Taiwan / 蝦餃).

Unlike other lounges, the buffet options are limited to sandwiches and wraps (and Taiwanese desserts!) found in the other section.

The taiwanese desserts consists of Mochi (different flavors are rotated), Pineapple cake, and a pudding (different flavors).

Then the section after the dining section is a lounge area which consists of the Solo Chair, a public dining/working table, and a lounge area.

Power options, theres USB and power outlets hidden away so it doesn't stand out. The solo chairs feature USB power (that outputs enough voltage to charge an iPad, which is also handy). The outlets support taiwan/US style plugs, as well as HK/UK Adapters. Although I suspect any country will work in them.

Towards the back of the lounge area there's a bar which has the usual drinks, some Cathay Signature drinks (some unique to Taipei), and of course bubble tea. The handmade coffee at the bar is not too bad too.

 The lounge area is actually my favorite area to work in (particularly the Solo chair MK2). But its good for relaxation too.
