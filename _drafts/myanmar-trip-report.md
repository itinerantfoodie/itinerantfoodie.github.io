My first trip of 2017 was a trip to Myanmar which covered Yangon and the area around the Bagan temples.

## Yangon ရန်ကုန်

While the city didn't offer too much in terms of tourism, due to population it does have a good amount of expats (and also usergroup meetups, and co-working spaces). Also the prices for food is quite reasonable (1000 kyats or less than 1 USD for a meal at a restaurant).

My main highlights are as follows.

### Ohn no khao swè အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ

This is where the Northern Thai dish Khao Soi ข้าวซอย originated from.

I've tried two different variations of this. One with less broth and one which was actually served as part of a free breakfast at the [hostel](http://www.littleyangonhostel.com/) I was staying at.

### 19th Street

This is a street where you can find cheap street food, as well as drinks (think mojitos for less than 1 USD - cheaper than cocktails from drink carts in Pub Street Siem Reap!)

### Yangon Circular Railway

For about 300 kyats, and 3 hours worth to do a full revolution (you may hop on and hop off, at several stops along the way) the railway offers an insight on urban and country life (on the outskirts) of Yangon.

The train also provided a lot of good people watching from all walks of life. As far as entertainment is concerned, it's just interesting riding on the train (as interesting as it is to the locals watching foreigners take the train too!)

During the 3 hours, you also have the opportunity to buy (very cheaply) from vendors on the train too.  I had a noodles dish mixed with curry for less than 30 cents US.

### Sule Pagoda ဆူးလေဘုရား

This was more a landmark for me, mostly "where you take the bus too" if you are heading towards the downtown.

If you want a true local experience, you can actually take a bus from close to the airport (Bus Stop "se mai") which goes all the way to "Sule Paya".

### Botataung Pagoda ဗိုလ်တထောင်ဘုရား

This looks similar to Shwedagon Pagoda, but located downtown. It was one of my first ports of call as I was staying downtown.

Entrance fees for foreigners is about 3000 kyats.

### Shwedagon Pagoda ရွှေတိဂုံဘုရား

This is the biggest pagoda and a must see place in Yangon. The pagoda is made out of pure gold.

Entrance fees for foreigners is 8000 kyats (or a little less than 8 USD).

### Other less notable stuff

For this trip it was mostly sightseeing, however for those who are digital nomads and need a place to work check out the following places:

* [**Project Hub Yangon**](www.projecthubyangon.com) - This is Yangon's first official co-working space. There's actually a startup scene in Yangon (complete with a startup weekend event!)
* [**CRAFT**](https://foursquare.com/v/craft/5662ca80498e680e9771c743) - This is a cool cafe (located around the same area as the Project Hub coworking space). Serves good european style coffee, and many south east asian dishes. The pricing is a bit closer to the pricing in a developed country, but the wifi is quite good.

## Bagan ပုဂံ

Next phase of the journey it was on the way to Bagan. Opted for a sleeper bus, through JJ Express where for 20 USD a very generous recline was offered plus a free snack and bottle of water.

The bus arrived just before the crack of dawn and it was time to check out the first sunrise and savor this opportunity.

### Bulethi Temple (Sunrise)

The first port of call was Bulethi Temple or better known as the "Sunrise Temple".

From this temple, there was an opportunity to see the hot air balloons as well. You can ride on them for 300 USD, but that costed 3 times more than the flight. But everyone says its worth it. I guess theres always next time.
