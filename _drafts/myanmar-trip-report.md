My first trip of 2017 was a trip to Myanmar which covered Yangon and the area around the Bagan temples.

## Yangon

While the city didn't offer too much in terms of tourism, due to population it does have a good amount of expats (and meetups). Also the prices for food is quite reasonable (1000 kyats or less than 1 USD for a meal at a restaurant).

My main highlights are as follows.

### 19th Street

This is a street where you can find cheap street food, as well as drinks (think mojitos for less than 1 USD - cheaper than cocktails from drink carts in Pub Street Siem Reap!)

### Yangon Circular Railway

For about 300 kyats, and 3 hours worth to do a full revolution (you may hop on and hop off, at several stops along the way) the railway offers an insight on urban and country life (on the outskirts) of Yangon.

The train also provided a lot of good people watching from all walks of life.

During the 3 hours, you also have the opportunity to buy (very cheaply) from vendors on the train too.  I had a noodles dish mixed with curry for less than 30 cents US.

This is the biggest pagoda and a must see place in Yangon. The pagoda is made out of pure gold.

Entrance fees for foreigners is 8000 kyats (or a little less than 8 USD).

## Bagan

Next phase of the journey it was on the way to Bagan. Opted for a sleeper bus, through JJ Express where for 20 USD a very generous recline was offered plus a free snack and bottle of water.

The bus arrived just before the crack of dawn and it was time to check out the first sunrise and savor this opportunity.

### Bulethi Temple (Sunrise)

Our cab driver offered to take us to Bulethi first (or the sunrise temple).

From this temple, there was an opportunity to see the hot air balloons as well. You can ride on them for 300 USD, but that costed 3 times more than the flight. But everyone says its worth it. I guess theres always next time.
