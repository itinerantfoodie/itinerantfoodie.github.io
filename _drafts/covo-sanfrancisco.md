#### Highlights

* It's like workshop, you choose between a coworking space or cafe. But more focused towards the coworking part.
* This place offers monthly plans
* Just a little bit cheaper than workshop
* Private phone call booths are available

#### Cons

* The surrounding neighborhood isn't such a nice place.

This is the latest edition to the coworking / cafe scene in San Francisco. It's quite new so its relatively quiet.

The highlights of this space is that it has a cheaper hourly rate than workshop, and there is private phone call / skype booths.

There is also a monthly rate for this space too for those who prefer some stability, but then again I'd personally use that money and get a wework hot desk pass which is probably better value because unlimited coffee and beer =P (and the community too).

The caveats here is the neighborhood isn't such a nice place (especially at night), but theres a nice Sichuan chinese restaurant across the road.
