Apologies for the lack of posts in the last few months, but as you can see by my instagram feed I've been in Europe either busy responding to enquiries from my online business or travelling. Hard to balance the two sometimes!

Anyway my reasons for this Europe trip is primarily business. First things first, to set up banking for my Estonian company, and also to attend web summit.

I decided on the date to get everything done which would be August/September where it would be on the cusp of Autumn but still having a chance to enjoy the European summer.

My initial Itinerary was:

* United Kingdom (mostly spending time in Scotland for the first time)
* Cross the Chunnel tunnel into France and ending the trip in Amsterdam where I would spend a few nights.
* Fly off to Tallinn for my initial business meetings, and also meet other Estonian e-Residents at a pub.
* Kept the rest of it open and somehow was to end up in Lisbon by November 6th

## The Actual Epic Trip

I decided I wanted to travel by land but regretebly skipped some of the nice Baltic countries and flying to Budapest.

In Budapest, I also made the mistake of staying for just a few nights (next time I'll visit longer!).

From Budapest, I did all my travels from land. Either daytime buses, or for longer trips via night bus (save the overnight stay!).

### The cities visited

#### Tallinn, Estonia

I chose Estonia because I had a few meetings to attend, and it seemed like a nice place to hole up in for more than a week (September meant it wasn't terribly cold yet).

#### Budapest, Hungary

Budapest was the first real travel stop. As an afterthought, I felt I could have stayed there longer because the city was amazing (and cheap too).

I wanted to check out the following things:

* Bitcoin ATM at Anker Klub
* Anker Klub
* The Chain Bridge

Along the way, I discovered some amazing coffee shops and also happened upon a nice coworking space through the loop.space app.

#### Bratislava, Slovakia

This was more a passthrough, but the key thing to see in Bratislava is the castle.

For those into blockchain, Bratislava seems to have a lot of meetups there.

#### Brno, Czech Republic

More of a passthrough as well but also visiting a friend there. Brno is a cheaper sister of Prague.

Not much for tourism there apart from the castle, and architecture. But generally a nice and chill place to hang out.

Be sure to visit Impact Hub in Brno if you're into tech / startups.

#### Prague, Czech Republic

My main reasons for visiting Prague was:

* **Paralelni Polis** - Bitcoin (Litecoin coming soon) only coworking space upstairs (Paper Hub), Bitcoin (or Litecoin) only cafe downstairs. I spent a bit of time coworking out of this place because paying digital cash from your phone (without asking the bank for permission) is cool. In this place, I got more into Litecoin being that its a lot cheaper for transactions.
* **Prague Castle** - This dominates the city landscape. A must see for ever Prague Visitor.

####  Berlin, Germany

I've been to Berlin many times, but my main reasons was to check out the bitcoin meetup at Room 77, and a few other Bitcoin related things.

Thanks to the loop.space app again I was able to visit rent24 coworking space. It's a cool space which includes a PS4!

#### Paris, France

Paris for me was mostly just to do some cliche things with friends (Eifel Tower picnic anyone?), and mainly to visit the Palace of Versailles which I have never had the chance to visit despite going many times and living there for 6 months.

I probably would have used it as a passthrough city and spent more time in Spain.

#### Barcelona, Spain

Barcelona was a bit of a continuation of Paris (checking out stuff I haven't seen), as well as showing a friend around the city.

Plus visiting one of the javascript meetups which happened to be on, and reconnecting with some blockchain people I met at web summit.

#### Alicante, Spain

Alicante for me was a passthrough city. Aside from the beach and castle on the top of the hill, theres not too much there.

But nevertheless still an awesome place to stop through.

#### Seville, Spain

Seville was absolutely amazing. In fact I should have traded in one of my days

#### Porto, Portugal

Porto is the last stop for
#### End game: Lisbon

The journey has not been written yet, but already planning to be in Web Summit for the 2017 edition.

## In Future

Assuming I can get a visa for Russia somehow (heard you have to return to the country of your passport to get it), would love to try the trans-siberian.
