你好 from behind the Great Firewall! I've decided to spend some time in China (as it's probably a good idea to give Thailand a rest for now. After all Nomadic means to reap the benefits of multiple places), and plus I heard Guilin and Yangshuo are beautiful.

I've also come up with a chinese term for my profession - 技術工作者遊牧 ("jishu gongzuozhe youmu" or Nomadic Technology Worker literally).

Here are some things I've learnt while nomadding in China, and some tips for future nomads who wish to explore this place.

## Mobile Phone Types

The best phone to use in China is the Apple iPhone. When you cross over into China, you'll notice that Apple Maps switches to a local mapping provider.

Apple Maps actually works quite well in the mainland (and it also offers pinyin translations into english too).. It also has detailed public transport directions.

## Money and Payments

You should probably have either WeChat or Alipay installed. Personally I prefer WeChat Pay as AliPay tends not to work if you do not have a Chinese ID (I've yet to test this theory out).

WeChat Pay works for most vending machines, small restaurants, hotels, hostels and you can book train tickets, bus tickets and flights. Also rent bikes and hail cabs.

WeChat Pay works in the metro in the following places:

* Selected stops in Shenzhen
* Everywhere in Guangzhou
* In Chengdu you can buy a stored value card with WeChat or AliPay

Using WeChat Secretary, you can cash in and out of WeChat Pay using bitcoin, although I can also sell you RMB for bitcoin / litecoin / dash if you ask nicely (at market rates for China)

### Bike Rental

I've checked different bike rental apps, and have settled on MoBike for coverage and it's foreigner friendliness (it works with Passport - and verification is only a few hours). You need a Chinese phone number though, but you can pick up one for 50 RMB.

## Internet Access

**Before you leave**, ensure that you have a working VPN. You might find it impossible to keep it updated when you are down there.

This is important if your email and documents is in Google Apps. Also Dropbox is blocked.

And if you need to upload stuff to Amazon S3, you occasionally get timeouts.

You'll also find Google Translate very useful for decyphering chinese characters for stuff

## Mobile Phone Data

If possible, get your mobile phone data from Hong Kong, it will let you use the internet unfiltered (but you have to pay a little bit more). You can always use a VPN, but this lets you skip that step. You'll still need a Chinese Phone number to reserve train tickets and take didi chuxing rides.

## Mapping Apps

If you're on Android, you should download the [Maps.me](http://maps.me/en/home) app before you go. In fact, even iOS should work too - however it's not necessary as the mapping on iOS uses a local provider (which also uses all the local APIs).

Fun fact, Taiwan is a province of China according to the iOS mapping API.

### Apple Maps

Yes it's actually better than Google. It will even give you public transit directions too, and has a very comprehensive database.

### Maps.me

Maps.me is a good Android alternative, and also a good alternative for iOS users too.

The key feature is offline maps so you can download maps when you're on wifi.

The data is actually quite accurate.

### Google Maps Weirdness

This is why Google cant be used here (even if you get it working using a VPN).

Note that the pin location is about half a kilometer away from your actual location. Don't try to use apps that depend on this API. It's useless.

Note to app developers (particularly travel apps!), learn about this limitation and build better apps.
