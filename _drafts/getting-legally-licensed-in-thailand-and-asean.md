For those who's curious about the process of getting a Thailand issued drivers license, I'm prepared to do a little document on it.

## Reason for getting one

First things first. The Thailand drivers license is recognized in the entire ASEAN region (including Vietnam where an IDP isn't recognized - so for insurance purposes you are still legal because you have a valid license).

The total cost of obtaining both motobike and car licenses is about between 500 and 1000 baht (depending on what documentation you are able to produce). Thats cheaper than an IDP, not to mention this lasts for 2 years.

## Documentation Required

* Residence certificate from immigration (500 baht plus waiting a day to get it) OR work permit. To obtain a residence certificate you need to show a lease agreement or letter from your landlord (or guesthouse/hotel owner). Hang on to the original, as you can use it to also purchase vehicles in your name too (but be aware it lasts for only 1 month)
* Medical certificate. I got mine from Chang Phueak Hospital for 80 baht.
* Copy of Passport, last entry stamp, departure card (you can do all those photocopies at the land transport office)

### Optional documentation

If you have any licenses in ENGLISH you may exchange it without having to sit for the test, although its not hard (just takes time - and they only run at certain times a day).

## Testing Procedure

If you have an existing license, you may skip either tests (except colorblindness test, which isn't very hard).

But if not you will have to do the knowledge and practical test. Ironically, you have to drive unlicensed to the land transport office in your own vehicle to do it. But I guess whatever.

The computer test is mostly common sense if you've done these things before, but I recommend using the great site at [thaidriving.info](http://thaidriving.info) to study. The questions I found at this time of writing is EXACTLY the same. I scored 100% on both the practice and real test.

Next, was the practical test which is basically a ride around a mock road with signs. It's fairly easy (especially if you have to ride to the office and have a bit of prior riding experience).

The hardest part was maybe the "straight line test", which is riding 10 meters on a 20 cm plank of wood without driving off (or touching the ground) the plank. Pro-tip: get some speed to do it successfully or you'll find it hard to stay on. They let you try again.
