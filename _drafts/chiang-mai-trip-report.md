I recently visited Chiang Mai finally for the first time, and wanting to return back to it.

It's basically set up for digital nomadism (a lot of cafes with wifi, and the speeds are decent; cheap rent so you can actually compete in the price war that freelancers have to contend with), plus it's an extremely safe place to hang out. And the food there is amazing. Also it's surprisingly english friendly (and also increasingly Chinese too). Not to mention, high quality 2 hour full body massages for less than 15 USD.

![Elephant](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiang-mai-elephant.png)

In terms of costs:

* A monthly serviced apartment rental will set you back for at least 8000 baht a month (~230 USD). Buying a place will set you back about 1,000,000 baht (about ~30000 USD)
* An inexpensive meal would be about 60 - 80 baht.
* Transportation maybe about 15-50 (depending on your bargaining) baht for a 2-3 km ride (probably best to get a motor scooter if you are there long term)

## The food

### Khao Soi ข้าวซอย

I came here mostly for this. It's basically the thing you need to try in Chiang Mai.

Here are my favorite places:

#### Khao Soi Khun Yai (ข้าวซอยคุณยาย)

![Khao Soi Khun Yai](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/khaosoi-khun-yai.png)

This place had the highest and most consistent rating across most of the online platforms. So naturally as a visitor with little time, that was one of the first places to hit up.

I was not disappointed. Although this place only does lunch and around the lunch hours only so plan accordingly.

It's in the old town though, and there is two good massage places around (one by current prisoners.. yes current prisoners as part of the vocational program which is rated on tripadvisor as one of the best places to get a massage, and one by former prisoners).  More on massages later.

#### Khao Soi Mae Sai (ข้าวซอยแม่สาย)

![Description](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-khaosoimaesai.png)

This is another good Khao Soi place, in the Nimman area.

Advantage of this spot is that there is a lot of cafes around this area (and also a branch of Punspace). Perfect area for digital nomad cafe crawling.

### Thai Roti

I've been recommended to try the roti in Thailand, by Roti Guu by some thai locals.

![Roti Guu](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-roti-guu.png)

There's also a cafe called The Baristro (เดอะ บาริสโตร้) which serves the Roti by Roti Guu too. Like all cafes in Chiang Mai the decorations is very instagram worthy.

## Cafes / Nomad Spots

There are a lot of cafes in Chiang Mai. Most of them have wifi so you can work away like a digital nomad. However, I think mixing it up with an actual coworking space (part time membership) - may work too.

The most popular one is PUNspace. Just remember, if you're a freelancer and visiting Thailand you need a work visa if any of your clients are Thai clients. If they are are non-thai its ok.

### Punspace

PUNspace is one of the famous coworking spots in Chiang Mai. So popular that there is two branches. Also keep in mind if you're nomadding on a visitor visa, that you can't have Thai clients (rumor has it that immigration has done some "compliance" raids on this coworking space).

![Pun Space](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-punspace-1.png)

### Ristr8to²

![Ristr8to](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiang-mai-Ristr8to.png)

This is one of the best coffee shops in Chiang Mai. Consistently rated highly across all online review sites. You'll pay a bit extra but its worth it.

<i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> Place details found [here](https://foursquare.com/v/ristr8to%C2%B2-%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AD-%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%95/4df88002d164d347cc72a67b6)


## Getting around

Around the old town, the place is extremely walkable. I'd recommend carrying an umbrella if you aren't used to hot weather. It can be useful.

For those taking the sukthaew (those red public buses that you see everywhere) or taxi cabs - the best spot to hit up the old town is tha phae gate. Once you get there you can walk almost anywhere within the moat area within 15-20 mins.

![Phae Gate](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/thaphaegate.png)

But for longer distances, you should probably hire a motorcycle (1500 baht a month which is around ~40 USD).

## Thai Massage places

I'll be covering one of the most popular and recommended places.

### Fah Lanna spa

![Fah Lanna Spa](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-fahlannaspa.png)
![Fah Lanna Spa 2](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-fah-lanna-catwalk.png)


#### Highlights

* Great service from start (even before becoming a customer you are offered tea), through to the end where you get a snack.
* Credit cards accepted (because it's high end)
* These guys also provide an airport transfer. Great to do this right before leaving.

#### Cons

* Be prepaid to pay dearly for it. But it's worth it once in a while. The basic service is about 300 baht (about ~8 USD) and the top of the range service is about 2000 baht (around ~55 USD) which is a food massage and normal massage for 2 hours.
* Have to make a booking.

### Current and Former Prisoner Massage places

The current prisoner (yes current) massage which is part of the vocational program  ([link](https://foursquare.com/v/chiang-mai-womens-prison-massage-centre/506f9d8ee4b06190ff461ea9)) is rated on tripadvistor and foursquare as one of the top massage places other than Fah Lanna Spa. For a full body 2 hour massage, it costs 400 Baht (~11 USD).

Although you can also go for a former prisoner massage which is just as good. ([link](https://foursquare.com/v/womens-massage-center-by-exprisoners/53ef2167498e8443c768a95d)).

## Chiang Mai Temples

### Wat Chedi Luang

![Description](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-watchediluang.png)

This is a must see in Chiang Mai. When I first visited there, there is no admission fee. But now there is a 50 baht entrance fee as this is one of the most visited temples in Chiang Mai.

### Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep วัดพระธาตุดอยสุเทพ

![Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-wat-doi-suthep.png)

This was not originally on the list, but my travelling companion who was accompanying me suggested this as the temple is quite photogenic, and has a nice view of the city.

The only issue is that this temple is at least 30 mins out of town so requires your own transport or maybe chartering a sukthaew to get there.

The going rate to get there is 100 baht, but if you're going to hire one privately you may need to pay at least 500 baht for one (the driver will actually wait for you.)

### Grand Canyon

Located in an area called Hang Dong, about 15 mins drive from the old town (Recommended that you hire a motorcycle!).

This is where you can chill out at a cafe and take it all in (what most locals do), or for the most adventurous dive off the cliff (what most "farangs" do).

![Description](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/chiangmai-trip-report-grandcanyon.png)

### Wat Rong Khun วัดร่องขุ่น (or the White Temple)

While this isn't in Chiang Mai, it's at least a 3 hour drive or ride (ouch sore butt) to the north. About 10 mins out of Chiang Rai.

This is one of the prettiest temples I've ever seen.

![Wat Rong Khun](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/chiangmai-trip-report/watrongkhun.png)

Along the way to Chiang Rai, there's a coffee shop which lets you immerse yourself in hot springs as you sip your latte. For the digital nomad, the cafe also has wifi. Just look for a somewhat abandoned temple which looks like a miniture version of Angor Wat along the way.
