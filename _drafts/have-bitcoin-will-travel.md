title: "Have Bitcoin, Will Travel - guide to Nomad friendly cities (Asian Edition)"
---

As a nomad, dealing with currency exchange is very normal. So essentially, I try to treat bitcoin like a currency only because converting to bitcoin incurs almost no fees.

I also have a preference for accepting payments in bitcoin too, and have preferences over businesses that take it. Got to put your money where your mouth is and keep the economy flowing (money, even gold has inherently no value unless you spend it).

Here are some countries that I’ve been to which you can use bitcoin in.

## South Korea
While I haven’t found too many businesses (apparently theres 1 K-BBQ place which takes bitcoin), this place actually has bitcoin ATMs to use. While the use of credit cards offers much convenience (and the opportunity to earn flight mileage!), there are several bitcoin ATMs around the city. Verdict: Support could be better  for those who don’t have an resident permits (particularly those from the UK and Canada who are allowed to remain in the country for 6 months) but at least the bitcoin ATMs work better than the traditional ATMs do.

## Hong Kong
This is very much like Korea. There is at least one bitcoin ATM which is two way, and I think a hotel (and long stay serviced apartment) which takes bitcoin for stays here.

There's also two up and coming places in Tai Kok Tsui which take it too. Again I think there should be better support here as Hong Kong is a finance capital.

## Taiwan
Thanks to a company called Bitoex, you can spend your bitcoins at any FamilyMart in Taiwan (there are a lot of them). That way you can buy your groceries.

There is also two guesthouses/hostels which also take bitcoin (unconfirmed), and a few bars.

I think with the FamilyMart+Bitoex partnership, living bitcoin is quite feasible in Taiwan.

There's also at least one cafe in Taipei which takes it (in Beitou) and one bar on Kaohsiung which takes it. Also if you're looking at staying in Taiwan on the long term, feel free to contact me as I can put you in touch with Bitcoin friendly landlords.

In addition, I think theres a cafe which has a bitcoin ATM.

I think, Taiwan is quite comparable to Japan where there is a lot of options.

## China
Despite Bitcoin being mined in China it isn't used so much as a currency but more traded off. The closest thing to Bitcoin is maybe an awesome service called [WeChat secretary](http://wesecretary.com/) where you can send them bitcoins and they fund your alipay wallet or wechat wallet.

## Thailand
So far I haven’t explored it that much, but I do know that bitcoin thailand lets you top up your phone using bitcoin. There are also several businesses scattered around.

## Cambodia
There's a coworking and coliving space in Siem Reap called AngorHub which takes Bitcoin. Also there's some places in Phenom Penh which take it too.

## Japan
Now we’re talking. Especially if we bring Tokyo in the scene. You can’t pay rent in bitcoin yet, but there are many bars and restaurants which take the currency thanks to some very enthusiastic members of the local bitcoin community there. In Kyoto, there's even a capsule hotel that supports bitcoin.

## Phillipines
Thanks to the Phillipines being a remittance corridor a lot of Bitcoin startups have decided to profit from this by using Bitcoin as a cheaper/faster  alternative to moving money across borders. One notable startup is called coins.ph
