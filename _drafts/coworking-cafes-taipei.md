I've spent the last 2 months in Taiwan (and most likely would come back), but centering this around Taipei as the place has been my base (I did do some side trips out of town, but didn't really note any coworking cafes).

Here's some places that I recommend:

* TRUST cafe
* hun space
* Arthere Cafe
* Barista Coffee
* Cafe Junkies
* Cafe Müller
* Beitou Library

I also have a more [comprehensive foursquare list](https://foursquare.com/nolim1t/list/coworking-spaces--cafes) (note: some of the places I haven't been yet, so I can't give any recommendations yet)

## TRUST cafe

![Work area 1](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/coworking-cafes-taipei-2016/tpe-coworking-trust-cafe-workarea1.png)

It's one of my favorite co-working cafes. It's set up for this thing. Communal work tables, fast wifi. Excellent coffee. Craft beer in a bottle. Printers. Lots of power outlets, and you can basically stay in this space for as long as you like. Even showers available. Word on the street is that this place my eventually be 24 hours.

Location of this is about 10-15 mins walk from Xintian temple (near Zhongshan Elementary School). But there is a closer MRT.

![Hun Board](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/coworking-cafes-taipei-2016/tpe-coworking-hun-board.png)

This is a cafe but marketed as a small coworking space. You can even get monthly memberships at this spot too. I like it because theres a good selection of teas and coffee, also different beers available.

You can basically stay in this space for as long as you like

Location of this is near Shida University.

## Arthere Cafe
**Workability Score:** <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> (Not really a coworking space, but getting there)

This is a cafe, but it's almost as if it's set up for working as each desk comes with a light and its own power.

The cafe serves a good selection of tea and coffee, and it seems you can stay here for a long time too.

Location of this place is close to City Hall MRT station.

## Barista Coffee
**Workability Score:** <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> (It's decent, theres a few issues, but its still a good place to work)

This is another cafe with a similar vibe to Arthere. There's power and wifi available, and the cafe is close to Taipei 101 building.

There's a good selection of tea and coffee. The biggest annoyance would be the wifi has a captive portal which seems to require re-login every 2 hours.

This cafe is closer to Taipei Arena (or the Ikea). There's "some power and wifi available", and there is craft beer here. The biggest advantage of this cafe is that it opens early, so that you have a place to cowork in the morning.

Bring headphones if you do want to sit and work as it might be quite loud.

## Cafe Müller
**Workability Score:** <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i>  (It;s decent. Few issues but still a good place to work)

This cafe is probably out of the way but it's another place to check out for a change of scenery. Power is only available at some tables, and theres good coffee, food, and alcohol available.

The place is quite quiet during the weekdays but as a precaution, always bring headphones to a coworking spaces.

## Beitou Library
**Workability Score:** <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> (OK  spot)

![Outside the library](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/coworking-cafes-taipei-2016/tpe-coworking-beitou-library.png)

This spot is ok. But at least you don't have to buy yourself a drink.

It's often full (don't even bother on weekends), so it's hard to find seating. The positive points is that the building looks cool, and it's near a hot spring.

Wifi uses the "TPE-Free-Wifi" hotspot that you see everywhere, so it requires registration with a phone number. Speeds are very variable - but I guess you're not paying for it.

As its a library it is usually quiet.

## Summary

My top 2 go-to coworking cafes would be hun and trust cafe, as the wifi and power available is quite good.
