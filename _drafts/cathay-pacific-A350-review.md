So I finally decided to give the much talked about Cathay Pacific A350 a try. And I've been very much impressed with my overall experience of the flight.

Cathay Pacific always never failed to deliver with their state of the art in flight entertainment system, but the A350 takes it one step further.

The business class system features  two consoles so you can enjoy multitasking between two things (watching a movie, and checking the outside cameras or flight map). Not to mention the LED lighting on the safety displays.

The cabin is pretty much the same as the 777-ER, but in terms of fuel efficiency the A350 I guess is similar to other Airbus planes in the Cathay Fleet.

My favorite selling point for the flight is the in flight wifi.
