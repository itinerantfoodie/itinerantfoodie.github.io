ATM fees - It's something familiar for long term travelers or digital nomads have to come to grips with at some point. But how do you solve this problem if you're constantly on the move. The banks certainly will not help (as you're making them money.. why change that?)

However, it can be avoided in countries where cash is king - and a good percentage of the population do not have bank accounts.

The countries where this method works is:

* Philippines (Tried and tested. Cash pickup)
* Thailand (Tried and tested. Cash pickup as well as domestic bank transfers)
* Vietnam (Haven't tried yet)

So what are these options?

The answer is **Bitcoin** or "*Plan B*" as I call it. It's always nice to have a Plan B while on the road. Who knows when the bank might decide to not give you access to your own hard earned funds (remember you don't actually own the money if you don't have it in custody).

With Bitcoin, you don't have to deal with this. I've even booked flights and paid for accommodation with Bitcoin (hopefully Airbnb supports it in the future for guests AND hosts).

The best part, the value actually increases at least 20-30% each year, and every 4 years there is usually a bigger increase (next year to look out for in the world of bitcoin is 2020 - the next halvening).

So how does one get bitcoin?

The best way is using the Abra app. You can deposit money into it through a bank or through the teller network and then you can convert your balance to bitcoin.

## Philippines

In the Philippines, there is a cool service called [coins.ph](https://coins.ph/invite/quhgsf).

Using this service you can convert your bitcoins into pesos at either a security bank ATM, or a remittance center.

You can even send your leftover pesos back into bitcoins at any 7-11 store for onward travel and who knows, the value might actually increase.

## Thailand

In Thailand, there is a similar service called [coins.co.th](https://coins.co.th). It's run by the same company as coins.ph, but works in Thailand.

Using this service you can convert your bitcoins into baht through either cash pickup or transfer to a local account.

Transfer to a local account is the cheapest, however if you don't have a Thai bank account - cash pickup works fine.

## Vietnam

In Vietnam, there is two main options

* [Coins.vn](https://coins.ph/invite/soti4h) - Although when I tried to sign up, there is no cashout option.
* [Cash2vn](https://www.cash2vn.com/p/howItWorks) - Haven't tried this method but it looks like a good option for people traveling in Vietnam.

Word has it, that there is a bitcoin ATM available in Saigon for bitcoin cashout, plus businesses which also take it.

## China

Thanks to the dominance of WeChat and AliPay, you don't even need to carry cash around in most places.

The best city so far to be completely cashless in my experience is Chengdu. You can top up your metro card using WeChat, and pay for most things using it.

To fund your wechat account, you can use WeChat Secretary to do it (with bitcoin) - however at a commission.

However you can use vpayfast.com to fund it by Visa / Mastercard / American Express / Paypal as well.
