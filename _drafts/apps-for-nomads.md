You might be wondering about what sort of apps I use to help keep track of travels

Currently, I sort my apps by country classification. Because some work better than others in different countries. And a general travel category.

## Communication

### Slack

Slack is useful for collaboration with teams (chat / file sharing). A lot of interest groups are also based on the platform.

### WeWork Anywhere

I am subscribed to WeWork as an anywhere member for the connections that it provides, and to use the space when I'm in cities which have WeWork available (mostly USA there are a lot of WeWork branches, but it's slowly becoming a thing in APAC)

### Facebook messenger

Believe it or not, I actually use that for communication with ppl. For the privacy conscious, you can use it without adding the person as a "friend" which is useful too.  

I also use this tool for introductions as well (create group chat with the person in it).

### WeChat

Used when in China, because you can do a LOT with wechat. And western services are blocked, so connections in China are less likely to use it.

## Collaboration

### Google apps

When it comes to Cloud, Google services is king. Although I do need to try out Apple's apps because Google is blocked in China.

### Quip

This is basically like evernote but designed for sharing in mind. They have a beautifully made Mac client, Mobile client and web client.

## General Travel apps

lets start off with the general travel apps.

### TripIT

As I'm in and out of short term apartments (or hotels/hostels and whatnot). I use this for planning where I'm going to be for that duration. Also any flights get logged here too.

### Swarm + Foursquare

Swarm is useful for remembering that cool bar or restaurant that I went to so that next time I can return. While foursquare is an excellent tool for looking at crowdsourced reviews. The data is quite comprehensive and it works in almost any country.

I also hook up foursquare to an app called [JetLovers](http://www.jetlovers.com/) which is good at collating travel stats into graphs.

I've also got a tool connected that I've built - not released yet. But it shows the breakdown of time spent in different countries - which is useful for working out where you should be declaring your taxes too and also to stay on the safe side with some countries where they can be strict on a maximum time limit for total visits per year (such as Japan, and probably the United States)

### Uber

Uber is probably the most useful travel app for getting around because it works in many countries, has a review system (so you are less likely to be cheated), has a trip history with the route the driver took (in so you can make sure the driver didn't take you the "scenic route" like taxi's love to do) and the best part - it's cashless so you just walk out and leave (And you can earn points on your card).

If you haven't signed up to uber yet, use the promo code - UBERISTHEBEST and you get a few dollars off your first ride.


## USA Specific

### Lyft

Lyft is Uber's competitor. I like using Lyft and Uber side by side to see which one is cheaper. There's probably apps that does this - but in iOS 10 (thanks to the new maps extensions feature), you can do this through Apple Maps which makes things a lot easier.

Like Uber, Lyft works exactly the same way.  It's a nice alternative if you see Uber surging and Lyft charging normal prices.

### Gyft

Gyft is useful for obtaining gift cards which can be spent at retailers such as Starbucks, Whole Foods or Best Buy. The attractive thing about gyft, is that they will take bitcoin and convert it to a stored value gift card which you can use to do groceries or shop.

I like using Gyft for Apple iTunes cards.

### Mobile Pass

This is a timesaver if you're traveling by air into the United States. You let it scan your passport, and then you electronically fill out the form through the app. Then when you arrive you scan the QR code at the border and also customs. No paper needed. There's a separate line for people who've used the mobile app too.

This is assuming you don't need a visa to enter the United States.

## South East Asia

### Grab

This is the equivalent of Uber in some South East Asian countries, although Uber may be also available there too.

It keeps a history, but doesn't show a map of the route.

The only useful thing about this is the reviews system (less likely that you can be ripped off)

## China (Mainland / Macau SAR / Hong Kong SAR / Taiwan)

### VPN

In China, you may find some services not working. If you use Google Apps for your email, it's essential that you have one.

I prefer to use PureVPN for my VPN uses (You can also have multiple devices too).  And the VPN accepts bitcoin for those who want to pay with privacy.

### Pleco

That app very useful for looking up words and also shows mandarin or cantonese pronounciation

### Kawa

This app is basically the Uber for coffee in Macau and Hong Kong. You purchase coffees in bulk (at a discount), and you can use the tokens in any coffee shop that the app has partnered with. You can also purchase unlimited coffee packages, which could prove useful for people using coffee shops as an office. (They need something like this for coworking spaces).

### WeChat

This is a useful app for just about anything in China. It's actually quite useful for payments. And you can also make payments using bitcoin (or convert your RMB wallet to bitcoin) through a service called WeChat Secretary.

## Finance (General)

I keep a USD account for dollar transactions (USD being the global currency). Everyone relates to some way to the US dollar, so it's a good frame of reference to use.

But also like to keep bitcoin so it doesn't have the same "vendor lock-in" that USD has.

### Receiving payments

For receiving payments, my preferred method would be to take bitcoin directly. Failing that, using Stripe is a nice option. You can just go very basic and use the very minimal Stripe.js or you can do something completely custom.

I've opted to do Stripe.js and used Amazon Lambda to process the payment. You can try out [this page](https://tips.nolim1t.co/) to have a feel of how I'm using Stripe on AWS Lambda (which means no servers!)
