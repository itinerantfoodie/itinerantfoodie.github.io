I've heard a lot about the Mae Hong Son loop from previous travelers, so I thought I make this something to do.

The bike I used for the first time was my trusty 2017 125cc Honda Click Scooter. It's quite economical on the gas (for the entire 600 km trip, I spent less than $10 in gas, and still had half a tank left over when coming back to Chiang Mai). The scooter handled the trip quite well being that it was quite new.

Next time I do the loop though, I want to try it on a bigger bike.

## On the way to Mae Sariang

### Wat Phra That Sri Chom Thong and Wat Phrathat Doi Noi

Along the way to Mae Sariang, I decided to check out these two Wats for some photo opportunities. While not over the top like the two Wats on Doi Suthep, Wat Chedi Luang, or the Wat on top of Doi Ithanon. It still provided a nice way to spend a break.

### Youngfolk/Bean and Brew cafe

Found this really cute and cool cafe in Ban Chomthong which is along the way to Mae Sariang. Because I was working on a couple of projects being a digital nomad, I needed some wifi for a few hours.

And of course iced coffee in Thailand is awesome.

## Mae Sariang แม่สะเรียง

Mae Sariang was basically a sleepier version of Mae Hong Son. Very local with few amenities.

I stumbled along a guesthouse called "Riverhouse Hotel" which had an awesome view of the river for a bit under $3 (low season prices!). The room was basic, but considering what I paid it is still good value.

## Mae Hong Son แม่ฮ่องสอน

Mae Hong Son is basically the "local" version of Pai. Rather than Pai being mostly foreigners, Mae Hong Son is mostly local.

There are 1864 curves between Pai and Mae Hong Son.

### Ban Rak Thai "Love Thailand Village" หมู่บ้านรักไทย

Nestled at the very northernmost corner of Thailand (5 mins drive from the Myanmar border), there's a village where there is villagers who are decendants of the Republic of China refugees (國民黨) . There biggest hint is that theres Taiwan flags around, as well as most of the villagers speak chinese as well as thai.

You can also try Yunnan Noodles 云南面 here too.

## Pai ปาย

Pai was basically my last stop before heading back to Chiang Mai where there is 764 curves. After doing 1864 curves on the way to Pai from Mae Hong Son.

Doing the curves was easy enough.
