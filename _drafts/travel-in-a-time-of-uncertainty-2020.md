Ok now you've read this far, lets say I have been giving this advice on a lot of forums and to others about various travel topics as a veteran traveler/nomad.

And I'm currently going through these motions. So theres my credentials.

And have come to the conclusion that 2020 is "nomading" on hard mode. It will utilize every bit of your travel knowledge, and if you can pull this off, you're ready for everything.

## The TLDR;

To sum things app here is a point form:

* Stay where you are / Move slower
* If you have to move, try to be as low impact as possible
* Share your tips to other travellers

## The juicy details


First of all the most logical choice is to head to your home passport country or a country where you have a 6 months to a year remaining on your residency permit (particularly if you cannot afford a prolonged stay, along with any emergency and visa costs). 

If the above is not possible or the way keeps getting blocked due to cancellations and stuff, the next most sensible thing is to stay where you are (assuming you can cover an extended stay AND emergencies without insurance).

Also please also meticulously pay attention to your insurance policy too. Policy dates are important. Also exclusions too. They will also send out policy updates. But be prepared for them to do a 180 and leave you with nothing. See the first point of trying to reach your residence country or passport country.

Local governments are always looking for solutions to accommodate you and in return you are also able to support local businesses, particularly hotels/guesthouses/hostels who depend on tourists like you so please look at those options and support the community.

If that can't be done try your embassy of the passport you have a valid country stay permit in (usually embassies will NOT help you if you are on overstay)  who may or may not assist you. But of course you'll have to build a compelling case. They may say no, but you still haven't exhausted all options. Some visa agents may be able to 'fix' the problem for an additional fee too.

But finally, If you MUST travel (because the above options aren't good), heres the official list of places you can go to and what their requirements are:

All airlines will consult this as well as the visa requirements for the next destination. Consult it every day, things change a lot (visa requirements also change too - to look them up check out Timaticweb).

For those with multiple passports (choose wisely). You can also choose which passport you wish to use (which is handy when it comes to visas - always pick the one with the best diplomatic relations with the country you are going to). A tip is to read the news from more than one source.

Even though some countries don't have quarantine requirements, you should always try to self isolate and social distance yourself as much as possible. Also put on a mask, despite WHO guidelines not to do it - as you could also be spreading even without knowing it. Asymptotic spreading is a thing.

You don't have to be absolutely zen perfect where its not enforced, but be mindful of your actions and the potential effects of those (distancing from the infirm/elderly is a good start, and also respecting them).

The virus teaches you a lesson in impact minimization on nature. So please be a good traveller and minimize your impact as much as possible. There are still countries with ZERO cases, don't start the chain.

Spreading viruses is like sending chain emails.  Only dumb and low IQ people do that.

The only impact you should leave is a positive one.

Do not infect the local community (who was already virus free, and maybe already struggling financially and cause more problems -> which leaves a sour taste for them to discriminate against ALL your countrymen or nationality. When you travel you are an ambassador for your country).

This may ruin it for everyone who's still either trying to get home or maybe trying avoid the chaos or impending chaos that is their passport home country for them. 

Happy travelling!
