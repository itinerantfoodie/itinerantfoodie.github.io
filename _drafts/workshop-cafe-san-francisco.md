#### Highlights

* Lots of power
* It's basically a co-working space without the commitment
* Order your food/drink the same way like you're ordering your uber/lyft ride

I found this site which was featured on the [workfrom.co](http://workfrom.co) site which was a site I was using to look up co-working cafes (and also scout for new ones) while I was working out of Taipei coffee shops.

This is basically a pay-as-you-go style co-working space (with cafe). But I guess you can come here for the cafe. The Co-working part of this place is interesting, because they also have a mobile app you can download which lets you set up a profile which is visible to the other participants so you could see who's checked in and maybe come and chat to them.

The reason I say co-working space, is because they have printing service, mailbox service, and many powers for charging devices. And you can go in and not order anything (you just pay the base rate - however, do download the app because you get some free hours. The app works with Google Voice numbers too) The wifi is also fast. You could also just use it as a co-working space too ($2 and hour, but with the app you also get some free time attached!).

From the co-working space, you can order from your table (through the app, or sms or email in an order). And for the super advanced, you can save your card in the app so you just order food just like you do ordering an uber.
