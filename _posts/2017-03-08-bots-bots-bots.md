I've always wanted to do this. But building one of this manually takes a lot of time. But thanks to one of the cool platforms called [ChatFuel](https://chatfuel.com), we now have a chatbot! The best part? It took a less than an hour to configure and test.

So getting the notified on the latest updates is easier than sending a message on facebook thanks to contextual menus.

For those blog owners or website owners, you should definetely check the platform out

Currently you can see the most recent posts from this website straight from facebook messenger
