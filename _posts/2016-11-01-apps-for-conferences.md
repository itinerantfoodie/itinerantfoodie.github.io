Quite some time ago I did a writeup [here(1)](https://plus.google.com/+BarryTeoh/posts/dMNGpXYmhXL?sfc=true) and  [here(2)](https://disruptingreallife.quora.com/Useful-Apps-for-SXSW-%2B-other-events-and-to-some-extent-everyday-life) about useful apps for SXSW.

I'm going to do a revisit for useful apps for conferences in light of Web Summit 2016 approaching soon.

While most of those apps still exist and useful. Some are no longer there.

Here are the category of apps I'll use

## Conference Specific apps
Each conference has its own app which is useful in its own right. Determining the schedule, messaging people in it.

The SXSW festival has one called "SXSWGo", all the web summit conferences (and its partner ones do), and last but not least WWDC and Google IO have one (although I don't recall if you can message someone on it)

## Messaging / Communications

* **Facebook messenger** - I feel it's one of the best ways of messaging (even supports secret chats too). Most people use facebook (and you don't need to be facebook friends to add someone). Adding is simply by scanning a messenger code.
* **WeChat** - The Chinese equivalent of facebook. Usually if the person doesn't use Facebook, they would be on WeChat (or not on any app)
* **Twitter** - This is good for getting "situational awareness" and discovering random things that happen. Conferences is about serendipity. Anything can happen online and offline

## Event Discovery / Networking
* [**Facebook**](https://facebook.com) - Facebook events are still useful. You can also see which events people you know are attending (or expressed interest in)
* [**Eventbrite**](https://eventbrite.com) - Useful for finding ticketed events
* [**Meetup**](https://meetup.com) - For finding local meetups. When theres a conference on there will be extra meetups
* [**Couchsurfing**](https://couchsurfing.com) - For hanging out with locals not related to the conference (good to meet a spread of people at the destination). It's not just for finding free accomodation, but it's for also event discovery.
* [**WorldPackers**](https://www.worldpackers.com/) - This is getting into the places to stay category, but if you wish to stick around a city for an extended stay - check these guys out. You can exchange skills for a place to stay (such as volunteering at a hostel, teaching english, doing nightlife tours, or even doing some web design/development).

## Place Discovery

This is what I use for getting my bearings.

* [**Foursquare**](https://foursquare.com) is my goto app here because of the network effect. And I just love the UX of it.
* [**Yelp**](https://yelp.com) is my secondary place discovery app.
* **Google Maps** also for another place finding app to crosscheck that the address is correct. I generally don't like Google Maps because of the privacy issue and it uses up a lot of data.
* **Apple Maps** - This has a bad name, but as of lately (iOS 9 / 10) - it has improved a LOT. Places wise it aggregates both foursquare and Yelp POI information which most apps are not allowed to do as part of the terms of service, but hey it's apple - they probably paid a lot to license the data. Apple also aggregate POI services in China too, and have a separate mapping service for China (the internet is different in China)

## Getting Around

* [**Uber**](https://uber.com) - This is my favorite transport app. It works literally everywhere. And now you can also call an Uber from within Apple Maps. Use promo code UBERISTHEBEST, and get yourself some free credit.
* [**Lyft**](https://lyft.com) - I use this to compare prices. If its cheaper, I'll call a Lyft. Otherwise Uber it is. The downside as far as I'm aware is Lyft only works in the United States. It's a shame because the app is so damn pretty.

What are you favorites? I'm all ears here.
