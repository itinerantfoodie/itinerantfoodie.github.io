Prior to 2013, traveling through LAX was a major pain. Now the whole international terminal has been revamped.

But back on topic, if you remember I've done a review for this lounge in 2015 on the [older archive](http://archive.itinerantfoodie.com/blog/post/oneworld-alliance-lounge-at-the-tom-bradley-terminal-in-lax). I've decided to move that post across with some fresh new photos and some older photos.

Despite the [Vancouver Cathay Pacific Lounge](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLG43DGjd9Z) being one of the best lounges in North America, you can't get to it unless you're on the international part of the terminal (not USA / Domestic).

While It's not like the new Cathay Pacific lounges it's still quite good for North American standards.

And this lounge can be accessed since the terminal connector was completed in 2016 so you can use the international lounge as a OneWorld member even if you are on a domestic flight (the American Airlines flagship lounge sucks, and you have to even purchase food and drink inside). While the international equivalent you don't need to pay for anything.

This is similar to what you can do with San Francisco where you can go back and forth between domestic and international terminals from the secure area.

Gotta love the US (and most western countries) where there is no outbound border control.

Anyway the lounge some distinct features.

First of all the all there is a bar area, and a fake fireplace.

Also a lot of seating. This lounge is quite big (and empty during the afternoon).

Internet speed wise, the speeds are quite consistent even in the evenings when you have a lot of transpacific flights going to various Asian destinations.

The bar is full service, very similar to what you would get at any HK Cathay Pacific lounges where you can get the bartender to make you up a cocktail or pour you a drink.

This lounge also has showers too. The shower attendant staff seem to be the same staff that bus the tables, but the service I found was quite attentive and friendly (so friendly I left one of the waitresses there a $10 tip - it's North  America after all)

Food wise, it's buffet food - but this is mostly a standard for most lounges.
