#### Highlights

* BBQ Pork Rice 叉燒飯
* Chichi Cocktail
* Dim Sum trolleys

#### Pluses

* It's close to the control point
* Beautiful design and furnishing for a non home port

#### Minuses

* Internet is slow at the best times to be at the lounge. However you can use the HK terminal wifi which is consistently good.
* No boarding announcements for non-QF flights (however, you shouldn't spend too long at this lounge)

#### Access Requirements

* OneWorld Emerald or Sapphire member and flying on a OneWorld Airline
* Business and First Class ticketed passenger on a OneWorld Airline
* Qantas Club member and flying on Qantas

This is the only non-Cathay lounge that I sometimes visit (when I am doing a redeye flight to either Europe / USA / Australia).

Bonus being it's close to the airport control point like the Wing is. Except it's on the right instead of the left.

The awesome thing about this lounge as I'm seen as a "regular" (at the bar!), even though I go to the lounge 3 times a year.

Because the lounge doesn't have champagne and the internet is often slow (maybe they are trying to emulate Australia?!), I mostly go here for two things:

#### BBQ Pork Rice 叉燒飯

The BBQ Pork Rice in this lounge a signature dish at the lounge. It's made to order so allow some time for preparation, and served with a side of kimchi.

Only available after 4pm

#### Chi Chi Cocktail

This is the signature drink for the Qantas lounge. It has a sweet taste to it so if you dislike sweet food, then it's probably something you shouldn't take.

#### Other features of this lounge

At dinner time, this lounge also has dim sum trolleys too. And this area has some communal dining tables which is very HK style.

#### Conclusion

While it doesn't have the stuff that the Cathay lounges has, overall, this lounge is a good choice for those flying on Qantas - It's better than the Qantas lounges in Australia (except the first class lounge in Sydney and Melbourne). You can also get in holding the Qantas Club membership as this is a Qantas lounge.
