Recently I've attended web summit - report [here](http://www.nolim1t.co/2016/11/21/websummit-2016.html). However this post is an extension of my trip (or "workcation"). I did opt to remain in Lisbon beyond the time of web summit to have a feel of the city without the crowds and a more sense of normalcy.

Not to mention use the opportunity to do a bit of Traveling (there was some parts I've never visited - Spain and the rest of Portugal). I kept most of my itinerary open and visited about 6 countries in the process (love open borders!). The way I did it was did the following.

## General plan

* Book the big flights first. Entering and leaving Europe. Obviously you may be expected to produce it at an immigration checkpoint (but I've never been asked or even then never had to show anything - but airlines sometimes do ask just to cover their ass, and you just never know if you may get asked). Make the big flights flexible (assuming you're a digital nomad).
* For Europe. Book the travel in and out of the Schengen zone (because my big flight originates and leaves from the UK). I chose to do a one way flight into Lisbon and exit the Schengen zone by Eurostar from Paris. At that time, how I was to get there remained a mystery. Next time, I'm going to try Flixbus into the Eurozone, as Lisbon immigration is a nighmare =P only 2 staff manning the checkpoints for a large queue.
* Have a rough plan of what countries I'd be heading to (subject to change obviously because web summit presents opportunities to meet people in different parts of Europe, not to mention the weather might change which makes visiting a particular place less attractive). I planned on staying a bit longer in Lisbon, visiting Madrid (to check out the Google Campus and some of the tech events), then flying to Berlin to check out the tech scene there, and then heading to Prague, and then taking a flight back to Paris. I eventually changed a bit of this "plan", thanks to some contacts I met at web summit (and also at hostels around Europe, even swapped business cards).
* Have at least the conference nights booked. For the conference, I opted to stay in the solace own room (airbnb private room) rather than shared hostel dorm (though I might try that next time, I'm sure there'd be more networking opportunities). But after social overload, it's sometimes good to have some "me time". Could have chosen a hotel, or entire apartment but I thought lets live in Lisbon close to what a local would expect to live (this is how I like to travel).

## Apps I used to plan

* Notes on iOS was used for making rough plans
* Trip IT was where my finalized plan would be entered in, synced with my phone.
* For flights, I used Hopper, Skiplagged, and CheapOair
* For ground transportation, I used GoEuro.com (and the app) to find deals on buses / rail. This is like Skyscanner but for Europe. GoEuro does Air transportation too. I also used the Flixbus app to find and book point to point trips by bus.

## Next, time to put it all into action.

* For accomodation: A combination of Airbnb, Booking.com, Hostelworld and HotelTonight to find good deals. Accomodation is always last, because theres always capacity somewhere.
* Weather wise, I was quite blessed. It only really rained 1 or 2 days in Spain, and maybe 1 day (night) in Amsterdam.

### Web Summit at Lisbon

![Lisbon Alfama](https://d3hs7z89jfjpsh.cloudfront.net/websummit-2016/resized-lisbon_alfama_district.png)


**Report on the conference**: [here](http://www.nolim1t.co/2016/11/21/websummit-2016.html)

I chose to spend some time in Lisbon (and also Europe) before the actual conference, but the conference started in the evening which afforded another entire day to explore and get familiar with the city. Two days leading up to the conference, there was already a web summit crowd in the city along with a web summit presence.

Why I chose to spend some time in Europe before, was simple. I wanted to make the most of the conference and not worry about being tired in the late afternoons (because of the 9 hour time difference). Plus, being physically able to stay up till 3 or 4 am each day means I'd have more awake time to meet people.

![Nighttime Baixa Chiado on Opening night](https://d3hs7z89jfjpsh.cloudfront.net/websummit-2016/resized-websummit_sign_nighttime_baixachiado.png)
![Daytime sign](https://d3hs7z89jfjpsh.cloudfront.net/websummit-2016/resized-websummit_sign_daytime.png)

So over the next 3 days, showtime. Attending the conference during the day, and hitting up the various parties around the city.

### Lisbon Gastronomic Experience

Lisbon is not just a city of awesome sights (street art, architecture), but also has must try foods. My Favorite is the Pastei de Nata (or custard tart). This is similar to the Macau style tarts (as Macau was a portuguese colony), but I also enjoyed all the foods at the [timeout market](https://foursquare.com/v/time-out-market-lisbon/56929539498e43f06f414c22) by Mercado Riviera.

For tarts, check out [Nata Lisboa](https://foursquare.com/v/nata-lisboa/51b60d06498ec014a82f55f3) which is also an "incubated startup" in Startup Lisboa. It's actually right downstairs from the coworking space.

### Post Web summit Lisbon

Then after that back to normalcy. I chose to remain in the same Airbnb for the entire stay out of convenience because the host was good, however next time maybe I'll do a shared hostel dorm post-conference because hostels in southern europe are super cheap (10-15 euros a night).

#### Sintra

There was a lot of things to tick off in Sintra. But the thing I wanted to check out was the Moorish castle. There's two ways up, either 5 euros by bus or a hike up.

We (me and another web summit attendee I met), decided to hike up but as it rained we decided to pay the 5 euros to go down.

#### Cristo Rei

The next day was actually a much better day but decided to go across the other side instead. Closer to the docks there's also a nice Urban art display too. Around the docks area (especially near the restaurant), was the perfect place to also scope out the sunset.

### Off to Madrid

#### Campus Madrid by Google

![Madrid Google Campus](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-madrid-campusgoogle.png)
![Madrid Google Campus card](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-madrid-googlecampus-card.png)

The following week after web summit, I took off to Madrid because I wanted to check out the Google Campus there. Which is part of the Campus network (London, Madrid, Seoul, Warsaw, Tel-Aviv, Sao Paulo). The campus network is basically a network of free (as in air), co-working spaces for entrepreneurs/freelancers. I loved the Madrid coworking space because it opens until 9pm (and there was still people there - startup passion!), not to mention the Madrid campus had its own snapchat filter! (way to reach out to the snapchat crowd).

### To Barcelona

From Madrid, I took off to Barcelona and luckily made that last minute decision because other than partying (and free co-working spaces), I also wanted some time to explore the countryside and also see some of the big sights in Barcelona (plus I don't like being in a landlocked city ;)). Madrid was quite pretty and also wasn't expensive, however Lisbon still wins out for prices, and overall street art.

![Sagrada Familia](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-bcn-sagrada-familia.png)
![View from the tower](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-bcn-sagrada-familia-view.png)

Barcelona, was a decision to basically see some of the well known sights in Spain such as the Sagrada Familia cathedral, and basically hang out for a bit and hang out with some people I met from Web Summit.

### Back to Madrid

After Barcelona it was back to Madrid in time for one of the blockchain tech events at the campus. Then also as it was a Friday night it was also a good night to check out some of the nightlife, partying at Joy Eslava (and meeting some awesome people at pub crawls).

I personally think that Madrid has better nightlife than Amsterdam (some places in Madrid offered an "open bar" aka all you can drink for 7 euros!). And no need to pay to use the bathrooms (I didn't want to drink much in Amsterdam because of that reason - **new app idea - find free bathrooms**)


#### Paella with Vino

### Now to Berlin

![Berlin](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-berlin-airport.png)

Berlin is an interesting city. It's basically a mix between Lisbon (Street Art) and Spain (history, also tech scene is much better). Berlin is also supposed to be another tech hub like Amsterdam.

Berlin has a branch of WeWork (which I'm a member of), and also I'd like to collect different WeWork stickers in Europe (not to mention use it as a base to sync up). Berlin has a strong tech scene as of lately, and even has a fintech/bitcoin coworking space - called transistor.

![Berlin Sunrise](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-berlin-sunrise.png)

![Berlin Sticker](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-berlin-weworksticker.png)

Berlin was also a fun place  too, in my short trip I found it hard to balance partying and working (need to stay a bit longer next time), as it seems like a happening city and not as expensive as London. Would have loved to try out the pub crawl.

### Detour 🚧 Amsterdam

![Sunset by the canals](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_0879.png)
![I AM Amsterdam](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_0919.png)

Totally didn't plan this originally, but life is about unexpected turns.

Another quick detour was Amsterdam. Instead of going to Prague, I decided to do a last minute night bus ride (39 euros!) to Amsterdam for another 2 web summit contacts and some quick catchups with friends. And also because Amsterdam is pretty cool too.

* Windmills are cool
* Tech city. Although because I just spent the weekend there, there was not many tech meetups to attend. I did check out the [Bitcoin embassy](https://bitcoinembassy.nl/foreign-visitor-facilities-info/) in Nieuwmarkt though.
* Love walking or cycling around (the city is like made for biking - bike lanes everywhere). It's somethings quicker to ride to a place over driving.

### Detour 🚧 Brussels

I did't plan on going here until the night I was leaving to Paris, I decided to do a quick pitt stop in Brussels to check out the following:

* Eat belgium chocolate
* Drink belgian bier
* Eat moules frites
* Check out the Christmas Market (theres a light show at Grokt Markt / Grand Place)

![Moules Frites](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_610370EAC907-1.png)

### Last City on the European continental adventure: Paris

![Eifell Tower](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_0967.png)
![Metro](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_0971.png)

Final stop: Paris just in time for a late supper or drinks (and some more friend catchups) and a bit of time to explore the city (photography during Magic hour is amazing) before heading back to the UK to end my european continental coworking workcation adventure.

Hope to do this again in Summer.

### Conclusion

Coworking hopping gave a lot of insight in not just travelling but also what it is like to be an expat in different countries.

My favorite European countries are:

* Portugal (Cheap, Artistic, and up and coming startup scene. I do want to check out [secondhome.io](https://secondhome.io/lisboa) the next time I'm in Lisboa again)
* Spain (Similar to Portugal, would love to check out the southern coastal areas and some of the co-living spaces)
* Netherlands (If I had the money to sustain myself there)
* Germany (except for flying in, the Airport in Berlin sucks)

#### Collection of Google campus Badges.

So far I have Madrid, London, and Seoul. I need Tel-Aviv, Warsaw, and Sau Paulo then I get the entire collection of badges.

![Collection of Campus Badges](https://images.itinerantfoodie.com/europe-coworking-2016/resized-IMG_0959.png)

#### Collection of WeWork Stickers

Throughout Europe, I spent also some time at various WeWork offices. My personal favorite is the newest Hackescher Markt office in Berlin Mitte area. Which is one of my favorite parts of Berlin. Lots of options for food and its quite central (although a bit pricier).

Berlin seems to have the most pet friendly offices, a few people brought in their dogs to the WeWork offices too.

#### Leaving

But wait theres more... I managed to see the newest Cathay Pacific lounge in London which just finished. More on that in a later post.

The Sunset is amazing there too.
