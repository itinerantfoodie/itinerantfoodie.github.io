Well 2016, it's been definitely a year of contrast. But at least it was exciting.

My goals for the following year is as follows:

## This site

* Make a mobile friendly web app for my image resizer tool which currently assists me with uploading AND resizing images to Amazon S3 and providing a Cloudfront link
* Automate the process of renewing SSL certificates with lets encrypt (and publishing it to github)

## Life

* Treasure the moment with friends / family whenever time permits (yeah sappy I know I know)
* Never settle. Keep on traveling this wonderful world meeting wonderful people. Have yet to explore Laos, and the Middle east. Am beginning to see the beauty of South East Asia.
* Cut the tether and close all personal bank accounts globally. Bitcoin FTW!

## Business

* Set up my Estonian business entity thanks to the e-Residency program
* Keep looking for more business opportunities (Hospitality / Travel sector) and room for growth.
* Get rid of toxic assets and expenses
* Automate processes
