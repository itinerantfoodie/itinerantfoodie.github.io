![SXSW](http://res.cloudinary.com/ztenl/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,h_450,w_750/v1426109342/vkkdewmvgvpec5yhsaqy.png)

This post is all about SXSW (or Spring break for technologists, filmmakers and music artists). The place where there are workshops, sessions, and of course parties (where the booze and food are all free).

And there's usually enough "business" value here to be here if you are either the technology, film or music industry no matter which country you are in.

First things first. What business value is there? Let's say there are people from all around the world (obviously US being that it is hosted there) coming to this event. To get this kinda of environment is very hard to miss. Although this works against you too as it is often said the signal to noise ratio is very high. Still, potential opportunities are opportunities. And there's also a high chance you will bump into celebrities on the streets (I know I have).

Next, the purpose of this post is also to give my tips and tricks for making the most of your time at SXSW (me being a 5 year veteran). Though I no longer attend as I personally thing it's grown too big (plus it was kinda awesome when foursquare use to throw awesome parties!)

## My Tips

* **Don't fully pack your luggage** You'll need room for taking all the free goodies back. I sometimes bring small bags that I can fold up.
* **Have a plan (and backup plan)** The entire city shuts down just for the conference, and a lot of distractions (which can be beneficial). So expect not to be able to be on time (or the person you are meeting). If you want to meet up with someone have a plan A and B (usually plan A falls through - the other person may get caught up somewhere or you may).
* **For those attending the conference, use the SXSW GO app**, to favorite sessions. favorite everything - then eliminate all the ones you think you can do without. Also keep in mind the distances between venues. It may also take longer to get between places as you will be navigating through crowds and being stopped by marketers. If you're traveling with others, maybe get them to attend sessions that you can't and exchange notes.
* **Pace yourself**, theres lots of stuff going on.
* **But, don't spend too long in one spot** unless theres value there.
* **Use Eventbrite to register for unofficial events** where you would most likely not need a badge.
* **Keep a folder for new apps to try** (sometimes installing apps may get you access to places where you can get free food/drink by the sponsor). You don't need to pay for anything for the first few days. The free stuff dries out after Monday.
* When signing up to stuff keep a specific email for this so you can track who's been spamming you and which lists you end up on. Sometimes if you attend more than once because you are on the marketing list you might even get invited to exclusive parties where you can network.
* **Wear comfortable shoes** - You will be walking alot and all day
* For those not used to how things work in the USA, **Carry your ID**. You will get ID'd at every place that serves alcohol no matter how old you are. It's just the policy there.
* **Bring a light jacket for nighttime**. It might be warm during the day but the temperature is known to drop to the 50s (around 10 degrees C) at night, even though during the daytime it might be 80 degrees. Springtime is a mix of summer and winter.
* If you're not staying downtown plan what you will need all day. Don't count on going back early. Also keep track of the last shuttle bus.
