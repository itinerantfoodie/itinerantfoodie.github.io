title: "2010's decade in review"
---

I think the 2010s for me was all about all the fruits of the previous decade paying off, as well as experimentation and consolidation.

A lot of learning along the way too (conferences).

## Summary - TLDR; edition

* Started my location independent journey
* Became a part time blogger
* Travelled on first class for the first time. Learnt how to travelhack and do business class flights more often.
* Experienced a lot of different business and first class lounges (Hong Kong so far wins)
* Improved and will continue to improve on minimalism, decentralization and mobility/freedom

## 2010 - Lets start this decade right

* My 2010 kicked off with life in the USA (New York / Boston / Los Angeles). I got to attend South By Southwest for the first time, and experience my first tech conference. Lots of learning / networking, and much parties (all on someone's corporate budget). And also got to do some serious roadtripping between US cities (highways are nice). 
* Ended with a mini-gap year in Europe and Asia
* From business trips, obtained Emerald One World Frequent flier (upgrades galore). So now was able to fly almost like the the 1% .. Decided that I'll try to maintain Sapphire at least.

## 2011 / 2012 - New Paradigms

2011 / 2012 saw the start of many good things later on (including this site)

As the Mayans did predict, there would be a big change in the world.

* Introduced to bitcoin. Got some free bitcoins from a website. The rest is history falling into the rabbit hole.
* Visited Hong Kong for the first time. Loved the cross section of eastern and western culture. That also influenced my later decisions.
* Started doing apps for other people who wanted them which timing could not be impeccable, as sales started to dry out and also with ROI.
* New beginnings of my [food and travel blog](https://github.com/itinerantfoodie/itinerantfoodie.github.io/commit/4c6a92bd41e2247b0941b653c4c380c0c87a5197) as well as [this blog](https://github.com/nolim1t/nolim1t.github.io/commit/4c6a92bd41e2247b0941b653c4c380c0c87a5197) on github
* In 2011/2012, decided to go back into the startup world again adding yet another SoLoMo type app in there (but with prettier UI!). Built a bit of it, however visions misaligned and left the team as a result.
* Started learning how to read Chinese (wasn't hard having Japanese knowledge). Also learnt how to read Korean (easy).

## 2013 - æ­¡è¿Žä¾†åˆ°é¦™æ¸¯

* Moved to Hong Kong (part of the reason was also to escape some drama ðŸ˜€ but found more with the umbrella movement â˜‚ the following year)
* Visited Taiwan for the first time

## 2014 - Eastern Exploration

* Visited China for the first time (not just Shenzhen)
* Visited South Korea for the first time

## 2016 - Transitions

* Migrated this blog over to a [new blog platform for the better](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/announce/2016-08-31/new-platform-new-look.html).
* Started being more transient as an experiment, Spent time (1+ months) in Taiwan / South Korea / Phillipines / United States / Thailand / Cambodia / Vietnam).
* Started selling / giving away stuff in hopes to be even more transient.
* Ended off the year in Siem Reap and start the next with a sunrise at Angor Wat.
* Attended web summit for the first time

## 2017 - Digital Nomad beginnings

* Started off the transient journey. Got an Estonian e-Residency and company instead.
* Started a new life in Thailand (March 15th 2017). Didn't plan on doing it but it just happened, and I ended up refunding my return flight. Discovered a community of remote workers. There was (and still is) a lot of temptation because its full of "gap year backpackers" and "full moon parties" which initially made it [very easy to be distracted](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/travel/2018-06-11/lost-in-paradise.html), but it seems ripe with many opportunities to build stuff and also having a nice serviced apartment sub $300 was a very good drawcard.
* Continued to more transient lifestyle in 2017 as discovered that visas don't last for too long, including a trip [throughout china](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/digitalnomad/2017-08-12/china-digital-nomadding.html), and an [epic land road trip](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/tripreport/2017-10-30/the-road-to-websummit.html) from Northern Europe to Southern Europe over the course of 2 months. The key take was some good business building connections out of Europe and also figured the Asia and Europe time zones are very similar.

## 2018/2019 - Slowed down with travelling 

* Became a slow traveller as found some long term stay options for Thailand as I loved Thailand a lot.
* Motorbike trip through Vietnam and Laos
* Unlocked Bali. Great for short visits but didn't seem very impressed.
* Explored some new Cathay Pacific Lounges, and paused my membership so I would keep my status.

## 2020s and Beyond - Moving foward

General gist of things is **decentralization** based on past experiences.

* More mobile / flexible / minimalism (consume less; travel with 1 hand carry bag) / sustainable lifestyle. Actually researching more options on working off a tablet and raspberry pi combo.
* Explore some more countries - Georgia is on my list. Also reconnect with some friends met along the way during the last decade.
