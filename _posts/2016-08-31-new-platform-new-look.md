title: "New platform, New look"
---

After a temporary hiatus in 2016 and lots of photos. See [here(1)](https://instagram.com/nolim1t) and  [here(2)](https://vsco.co/nolim1t) - we're finally back with a new look and back to basics as an MVP.

## Here are some of the features:

* [Static hosted site](http://www.nolim1t.co/2016/06/20/jekyll-as-a-blog-platform.html) (No databases!), with some dynamic components such as the "Last seen" widget that I've added to many of my blogs. I plan to bring back the wiki soon too, and going serverless too. Refer to my [tech blog](http://nolim1t.co) if for posts on going serverless.
* Full SSL support (because 2016, and all)
* Same commenting system as before, because we are using disqus)
* Ability to write posts in markdown thanks to jekyllrb.

## Roadmap

* Bring back the food and place wiki (go full serverless with static reactjs HTML page driving it, and eventually maybe react native app)
* Tweak last seen to show restaurant name if the last seen place is a restaurant (with privacy fuzzy filter of course)
* Instagram (maybe VSCO) widget

## Post content

I'm pretty much keeping the same theme to this site:

* good food
* travel (destinations, airlines, lounges)
* Tips (insurance, banking, visas, finding coworking spaces or good cafes etc) on how to be a digital nomad or be a "9-5 cube refugee" (2016 and all - it's the future of work)
