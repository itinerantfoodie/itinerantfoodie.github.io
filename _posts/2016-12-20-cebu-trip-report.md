While I'm not really a big fan of Manila, Cebu (and the Visayan region) is a cool place to be for the particular reasons:

## Food

* In Cebu there is a term used by locals called Food Crawl. Think of a pub crawl, but instead of drinking alcohol - it's eating food.
* The most famous food to try is Lechon, which is a BBQ roasted pig. T

## Beaches

* The beaches are mostly on Mactan Island and seem linked to resorts.
* My most recent trip, I stayed at Movenpick resort on the last night. The resort had a private beach and offered a lot of good amenities for less than 100 USD a night.
* A little outside of the town you can swim with Whale sharks too.

## For the Digital Nomad

* **Co-work spaces** For the digital nomad, there's cowork spaces around. You'd want to check them out as mobile internet is horrible in the Phillipines (I lost count of how many dropouts I've had, and had to reset the network to have it work to get stuff done). There's two around the IT park area, and a newer one around the Ayala Center area which opened in October.
* **No need to do visa runs.** Most visitors can remain in the Phillipines indefinetely (just have to renew the visa before it expires). Perfect for a digital nomad
* **Coins.ph** - Again for the digital nomad, avoid ATM fees and use bitcoin. Sure it fluctuates in price, but so does your dollar. Over time, the value increases so it's also good for long term savings. I use it to withdraw money from the ATM (and also to top up my sim card) - at better rates than using an ATM card. You can also send money to other people too - either bank or by text message. It's great being in a country where people are unbanked.
* **Abra** - This is available in the Phillipines too. It's basically a bank account but without a bank account. For those who dislike volatility of bitcoin, Abra deals with dollars and pesos. And also works in the united states

## Parties / Nightlife

* In Cebu, you have Mango Square
* However, you a short flight away you also have Boracay which is one of the Ibizas of Asia (and good weather generally all year round)
