Apart from Brexit, 2016 has been a good year for OneWorld travelers flying in and out of London Heathrow. With first this lounge reopening in August 2016, and then the Cathay Pacific outgoing lounge in later in the year in December.

Generally, I rather fly directly into Europe (rather than the UK first)- however I chose London Heathrow because of the two lounges.

But having an arrivals lounge is a good thing when your flight arrives early in the morning, so you can take a shower to freshen up and spend a few hours using the free wifi (and drinking champagne) while waiting for your check in time to start.
