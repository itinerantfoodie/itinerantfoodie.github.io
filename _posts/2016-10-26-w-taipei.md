My first hotel review but I've chosen W Hotel in Taipei because it's probably one of my most memorable stays and the best 5 star hotels I've ever stayed at.

So good that If I ever stayed in a hotel in Taipei, I'd probably only pick this one only.

Even before checkin, you're already in touch with the concierge staff so they can arrange anything beforehand (such as the luggage forward service). You can also request different types of pillows as most international 5 star hotels let you do.

Next the arrival - you have the option to arrive and leave in style by a nice sports car or limo (roughly $100 USD for the privilege of doing so or 3 times the price of a taxi). However, if you don't need to have an airport transfer the hotel is right next to the City Hall bus station.

Then you check in at a lobby right next to the Woobar (which becomes a nightclub after 10 pm and some beautiful check in staff aka "W Hotel Talent").

The rooms have a pretty good view of the city. On one side you can clearly see the Taipei 101 building. On the other side you can see the Keelung road intersection near the MRT City Hall station.

The rooms of the hotel was quite spacious. King sized bed plus a +1 bed for either an additional guest (complimentary) or just for relaxation.

Along with plenty of room amenities (USB power, universal plugs, HDMI for plugging a laptop or other device into the surround sound and HDTV system). And complimentary snack basket and fruits.

The bathroom within the guest rooms had a lot of toiletries which was restocked daily (even on the last day). Generally hotels stop doing this on the last day, but this wasn't the case here.

The other facilities within the hotel was also good. During the daytime, a restaurant called "The Kitchen Table" for buffet breakfast/brunch and at nighttime a mixology bar called "Woobar / WETbar" which also has a swimming pool (and yes you can swim in there - there are changerooms provided on site as well).
